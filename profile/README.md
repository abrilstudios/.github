# 🛰️ Abril Studios

**Engineering at the edge of art, AI, and autonomy.**

Abril Studios builds experimental tools for visual artists, musicians, engineers and creatives. We explore workflows tools that push boundaries of human constraint with machine learning, with a focus on exploring lost technology histories and designing systems that think with the artist.

We believe in:
- **Tools that extend human agency**, not automate it away  
- **Open standards** and alignment between interface and intent  
- **Intelligent agents** that scaffold creativity—not replace it

🛠️ We prototype fast, document always, and collaborate openly.

> “What begins as controller mappings ends as an operating system for the creative stack.” — A.S.

🌐 More to come. For now: we're building.
